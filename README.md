# Powerstatus10k Bluetooth Segment

This segment displays the bluetooth status. It differs the icon depending on
controller power and if a device is connected. If connected to at least one
device, it shows the name of the first listed device. If more than one device is
connected, a count of additional devices is displayed.

**This requires `bluetoothctl` to be installed**.
On _ArchLinux_ this can be installed via the `bluez-utils` package.
